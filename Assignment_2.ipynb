    "In summary, all three expressions generate the same sequence of numbers. The difference lies in how you specify the arguments for the range() function, but their outputs are identical. By default, if you only provide one argument, it represents the stop value, and the start value is assumed to be 0. If you provide two arguments, they represent the start and stop values, respectively. Lastly, if you provide three arguments, they represent the start, stop, and step values, respectively.\n",
