    "Functions are advantageous to have in your programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, self-contained units that perform specific tasks. This modularity makes your code easier to manage, understand, and maintain. Additionally, once you create a function to perform a particular task, you can easily reuse it in different parts of your program or in other projects, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions abstract away the implementation details of a specific task, providing a higher-level interface for other parts of your code to interact with. This simplifies the code for the rest of the program, as other parts don't need to know the inner workings of the function; they only need to know how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Maintainability: By breaking your code into smaller, well-named functions, you make the code easier to read and understand. This helps you and other developers quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of different parts of the program. Readable code is also more maintainable since it's easier to identify and fix bugs or make changes when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Organization: Functions help you organize your code logically. Instead of having a large monolithic block of code, you can group related tasks into separate functions, making it easier to manage and navigate your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging and Testing: When you encounter issues in your program, functions can act as isolated units that you can test individually. This makes debugging more manageable since you can focus on a specific function and check its inputs, outputs, and behavior independently of the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Development: When working in a team, functions allow different team members to work on separate parts of the program simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. By defining clear interfaces for functions, you establish a contract that helps ensure proper integration between different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability and Libraries: Functions are not only beneficial within your program but also in the context of libraries and APIs. Many programming languages come with standard libraries and external packages that offer a collection of useful functions for various tasks. You can leverage these libraries to speed up development and utilize well-tested and optimized code.\n",

    "SomeExceptionType is the specific type of exception you want to handle. For example, you can use except ZeroDivisionError to handle division by zero errors or except FileNotFoundError to handle file not found errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the try clause allows you to protect a block of code that might raise exceptions, and the except clause defines how the program should handle those exceptions when they occur. Together, they provide a mechanism for controlled error handling, helping you make your programs more robust and preventing them from crashing due to unexpected errors."
