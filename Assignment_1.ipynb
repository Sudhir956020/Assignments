    "Ans. String:\n",
    "A string is a data type that represents a sequence of characters. Characters can include letters, digits, symbols, and whitespace. In most programming languages, strings are enclosed within single quotes (' '), double quotes (\" \"), or triple quotes (\"\"\" \"\"\"). Examples of strings:\n",

    "\"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "'12345'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable:\n",
    "A variable is a named storage location in a program's memory that holds a value. It acts as a container to store and reference data during the execution of the program. Variables can store various types of data, including strings, numbers, booleans, and more.\n",
    "When you declare a variable, you provide a name for it, and you can assign a value of a particular data type to it. The value of a variable can change during the execution of the program, depending on the operations performed on it.\n",

    "The integer data type represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional or decimal components.\n",
    "\n",

    "3.String:\n",
    "The string data type represents a sequence of characters and is used to store textual data. Strings are enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes (\"\") in most programming languages. They can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. Strings are immutable in many programming languages, meaning their contents cannot be changed once they are created. However, operations like concatenation and slicing can be performed on them.\n"

    "\n",
    "The basic components that make up an expression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: Fixed values that do not change during the evaluation of the expression, such as numbers (e.g., 5, 3.14) or strings (e.g., \"hello\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Symbols that represent changing values during the execution of a program or calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators: Symbols or keywords that perform operations on the constants and variables to produce a new value. Common operators include arithmetic operators (e.g., + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division), comparison operators (e.g., == for equality, > for greater than, < for less than), and logical operators (e.g., && for logical AND, || for logical OR).\n",

    "Function calls: Invoking functions to perform specific operations and return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expressions, regardless of their complexity, have one primary purpose: to compute and produce a single value as the result of the evaluation. The evaluation follows specific rules based on the precedence of operators and the type of expression being used. For instance, in arithmetic expressions, the order of operations dictates how the expression is evaluated, following the PEMDAS/BODMAS (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) rules.\n",
